### gaia-kepler.fun

This repo contains source code and demos for the Gaia-Kepler crossmatches at (gaia-kepler.fun)[http://gaia-kepler.fun].

Various utility functions for cross-matching and data munging written in python are located under `scripts`. 
A demo Jupyter notebook which reads in the cross-match and makes cool plots (including color-magnitude diagrams displayed on the website, interactive bokeh versions, and a fun animation) can be found at `notebooks/demo.ipynb`.

The website is built on (Bootstrap)[https://getbootstrap.com/] using a slightly modified version of the theme (Creative)[https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-creative].
